      Ladies, gentlemen and those who are still determining,

      My name is Alexandra Bulgakova and I am a writer, poet and psychologist with a passion for literature, music and philosophy. As a child, I dreamed of drawing and writing piano music, but as Mick Jagger sang, you can't always get what you want, and closer to adulthood I found another way to convey the world through the prism of my own perception - literature.

      I've lived with ADHD and bipolar disorder for 30 years, in the course of which I've expanded the boundaries of the subconscious, achieved mindfulness and gone a little crazy, only to rise back up with renewed strength and knowledge. I would be happy to help you restore your spirit and heal your soul. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. I am also always happy to receive feedback from readers, because for a poet there is nothing more wonderful than to open the window of his subconsciousness and have tea with a random passerby.

      I can say the following about myself: Castaneda didn't believe it, Ian Curtis smoked, Stephen King wrote it down, and Yegor Letov sang along... So I'm flying over the cuckoo's nest, enjoying the panorama.

      Peace. Empathy. Metaphysics.
