Hello, friends!

I am very happy to welcome you to my blog, where I talk about my books and share my new story with you. The new book is not about bipolar disorder, not about love, not about depression, not about happiness, not about life and not about death. But it is about all of these at the same time. This is a story about how we can learn to live with those emotions that seem difficult to us, and how we can find our way to happiness. I think this story can be useful for each of us, and I invite you to read it and share your thoughts with me. Thank you for being with me, and I hope that we can go through this path together!
